## About LPG
The LALR parser generator ([LPG]( https://github.com/kuafuwang/LPG2 )) is a tool for developing scanners and parsers written in TypeScript, C#,Java, C++ or C. Input is specified by BNF rules. LPG supports backtracking (to resolve ambiguity), automatic AST generation and grammar inheritance.
